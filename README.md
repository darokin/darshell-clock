**darshellclock** is a *MINIMALIST* console application to display time and date with nice ASCII digits in your terminal. Uses *curses*

Here is a demo but mostly you would use this in a small persistant terminal. (More on "why this project?" in the side notes at the end)

## Features

Suitable for quite small terminal sizes.
Useful for having a clock sitting around if you use a tiling window manager or tmux for example.

 - Nice 'blocky' ASCII digits
 - Localised date format
 - 2 sizes of digits, smaller digits for smaller term
 - Autoresizing and centering
 - Color selection of the time or the date
 - Possibility to hide the date and/or the seconds
 - Autoclosing (if wanted, see arguments in 'Usage and keys')
 - All the parameters are saved upon exit
 

## Usage and keys

The usual arguments are here + a 'stop' argument for the autoclosing functionnality
```
-h --help        Show help
-v --version     Show version number
-i --info        Show info [ASCII â™¥]
-s --stop STOP   Quit the application after <STOP> seconds
```
While in the app, use these keys to change the configuration :

| Key  | Purpose          
|------|--------------------
| h    | Show or hide help |
| q    | Quit              |
| z    | Change time color |
| x    | Change date color |
| d    | Show or hide date |
| s    | Show or hide secs |

## Side notes

This program was mainly made to try out a whole life cycle of a simple python app and to grasp new skills around github/CI/python package distribution/etc.
